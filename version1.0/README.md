# Usage

#### These Websites were tested with xampp webserver on a linux server, so I would reccomend using xampp to.

- Install xampp on your machine using this [guide]
- clone the repository into the /opt/lampp/htdocs directory
- open a terminal in the /opt/lammp directory and write sudo ./xampp start
- lastly go to enter localhost/htdocs/<path to file>
- Attention! when on index.php page and there is no manu please set ?lang=de or ?lang=eng
