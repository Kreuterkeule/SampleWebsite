# Usage

#### These Websites were tested with xampp web server on a Linux server, so I would reccomend using xampp to. Unfortunately the website is only build for a 16:9 full screen. Sometimes the css wouldn't load probably if so use private window in your browser

- Install xampp on your machine using this [guide]
- clone the repository into the /opt/lampp/htdocs directory
- open a terminal in the /opt/lammp directory and write sudo ./xampp start
- lastly go to enter localhost/htdocs/\<path to file\>
- Attention! when on index.php page and there is no menu please set ?lang=de or ?lang=eng

- there was a small problem with a skip mark: they display the content with given id right in top and not in middle of site. I would appreciante it if someone could comment down below how to fix this problem. What I did is a bit lame; I just took the id of the content above.
- also it would be nice if someone could tell me how to not scroll to top when opening a new site. In this case changing the language
